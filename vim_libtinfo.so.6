[Scenario]
after updaing vim editor, I cannot use it.

[Error Message]
"vim: error while loading shared libraries: libtinfo.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

[Reason]
After checking my own library with
    ls /usr/lib/ | grep libtin
,it shows nothing.
I think it is because of my Manjaro did not have libtinfo.so.6 library.

[Solution]
===Failed example===
I tried to download lib32-libtinfo from ARU and link the library with
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtin.so.6 /usr/lib/libtinfo.so.6
but failed.
It shows
"vim: error while loading shared libraries: libtinfo.so.6: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32"
Hence, I unlinked it.
    sudo unlink /usr/lib/libtinfo.so.6

===Successful example===
Download the ncurses-full-git from AUR (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ncurses-full-git/),
and by the info on "https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/updated-vim-error-message-missing-libtinfo-so-6-a-4175611965/".
Firstly, I check what library has in ncurse with
    ls /usr/lib | grep ncurse
,then I tried to link each *.so library one by one, and only success with
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libncursesw.so.6 /usr/lib/libtinfo.so.6
